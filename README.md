Application of the algorithms of Dijkstra and Roy Warshall in Python

- The first algorithm will determine the vertex minimizing the sum of the travel times of the two
friends. In the example above, the optimal meeting place for this criterion is point b.

- The second algorithm will calculate the vertex minimizing the sum of the number of paths / arcs traveled
by the two friends. There are several vertices satisfying this criterion, he will choose one which minimizes the
sum of journey times. 
We can note that node g also offers a number of routes equal to 3 but the total time is
18. The first solution will therefore be chosen.
